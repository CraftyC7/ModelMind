# ModelMind

This Flask application serves as an intelligent financial data assistant, allowing users to upload Excel files containing financial data and then ask questions about that data. It leverages a pre-trained language model (FLAN-T5-Small) for natural language understanding and generation, along with a custom data extraction and query engine for accurate financial calculations.
